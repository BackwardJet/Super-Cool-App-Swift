#Super-Cool-App

My first iOS application built using Swift. The app consists of two views. 
* The first view is an uncool view of just a button which reads "Make Me Super Cool!".
* The second view is a cool view with a logo reading "Boom App" and a background.
By pressing the button on the first page, you reach the second page.
